        "In Machine Learning (ML), cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y). This is typically expressed as a difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value.$^{[1]}$ One common cost function that is often used and will be used in this sesisons is mean squared error (MSE), which measures the difference between the ground truth ($y_i$) and the estimated value ($\\hat{y}_i$). \\\\\n",

        "The cost function (you may also see this referred to as loss or error.) can be estimated by iteratively running the model to compare estimated predictions against “ground truth” — the known values of y. The objective of a ML model, therefore, is to find parameters, weights or a structure that minimises the cost function.$^{[1]}$ Gradient descent is an efficient optimization algorithm that attempts to find a local or global minima of a function. **Gradient descent** enables a model to learn the gradient or direction that the model should take in order to reduce errors (differences between actual y and predicted y).$^{[1]}$\n",
